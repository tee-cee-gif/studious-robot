    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal page! I am passionate about technology, learning, and creating impactful solutions.</p>
    <p>My name is Theophilus Chika Theophilus Chika Amadi and I guess trying to figure out why 
        my parents decided to double my name, ignited my love for computers. 
        Computer science has always been my beacon of hope, promising a future filled with 
        endless possibilities.  
        Born into a modest family in a beautiful town in Port Harcourt, I grew up surrounded by 
        stories of perseverance and hard work from my parents.  
        They didn't know much about information technology (IT), but they instilled in me a deep 
        appreciation for learning and a relentless drive to excel in the tech world.</p>
